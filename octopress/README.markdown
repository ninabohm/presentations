### Introduction (0min)

Who has a blog? Why? What do you use?

Blogging is important for many reasons:

* Gets feedback
* Helps conceptualize ideas
* Improves your written communication skills
* Good for getting your name out there

Octopress is great because it doesn't require server side processing so you can host it easily. Don't have to worry
about getting something like Wordpress hacked. It's good for exercising git knowledge
