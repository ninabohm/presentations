# Personal Accounting with GNUCash

Personal accounting can be shown in a very simplistic way that doesn't model real world
transations. This is an attempt to exercise the more complicated (to me) line items.

### Setup

Create a brand new book in GNUCash with a basic chequing accounts

#### Basic Transactions

Using your debit card account for the following:

- lunch expense
- drinks at the pub
- pay rent

Everyday transactions aren't always with your debit card though. Now simulate
the following:

- withdraw $100 from an ATM (with fees/without fees)
- pay for a round of drinks with cash

#### Lending

A friend needs some money. You lend them some money and do not charge interest

- lend a friend $1000
- your friend repays $500 at some later date

How does this activity change your networth? How does it affect your friends
networth?

- borrow money from a friend $250
- how do you see how much you owe?
- you pay back the debt

How does one compare loan obtained, vs loaned made.

#### Income/Equity

- receive a monthly pay cheque
- sell a piece of property

Complicate salary transactions

- receive a pay cheque in gross amount but split across Asset and Expense accounts

#### Reimbursements

- pay for dental visit
- receive 50% reimbursement for the above dental visit
