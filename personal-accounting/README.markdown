# Personal Accounting with GNUCash

## Background

I've been money conscientious since I got my first job when I was 10. I loved
going to the bank to update my bankbook so see how my account had grown. It
also made me conscientious of spending. Like building anything, it takes a lot
of effort to build something up, but not much to tear it all down. This imbalance is why I believe it's important to do accounting. For me it tells me
the following:

* Are there any unhealthy spending habits emerging (lifestyle creep)
* Am I meeting my targeted savings rate
* How much accessible money do I need in an emergency

For more information I recommend the [Personal & Family Financial Planning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/family-planning) course on Courera.

Here is my personal accounting journey

* Started out using [GnuCash](http://gnucash.org/) in 2004
* Wesabe in 2008 because it's "smarter"
* In mid 2009 Wesabe shut down and Mint began supporting Canadian banks
* 2015 moved to Europe which Mint didn't support so I went dark
* 2017 went back to GnuCash and learned that I could still open my files from 2004

## Back to GnuCash

Personal accounting can be shown in a very simplistic way that doesn't model real world transations. This is an attempt to exercise the more complicated (to me) line items.

### Setup

Create a brand new book in GNUCash with a basic chequing accounts

#### Initializing Your Books

This was a bit of a hurdle for me to get started:

- create a book with an initial balance of €1000

#### Basic Transactions

Using your debit card account for the following:

- lunch expense
- drinks at the pub
- pay rent

Everyday transactions aren't always with your debit card though. Now simulate
the following:

- withdraw €100 from an ATM (with fees/without fees)
- pay for a round of drinks with cash

#### Lending

A friend needs some money. You lend them some money and do not charge interest

- lend a friend €1000
- your friend repays €500 at some later date

How does this activity change your networth? How does it affect your friends
networth?

- borrow money from a friend €250
- how do you see how much you owe?
- you pay back the debt

How does one compare loan obtained, vs loaned made.

#### Income/Equity

- receive a monthly pay cheque
- sell a piece of property

Complicated salary transactions

- receive a pay cheque in gross amount but split across Asset and Expense accounts

#### Reimbursements

- pay for dental visit
- receive 50% reimbursement for the above dental visit
