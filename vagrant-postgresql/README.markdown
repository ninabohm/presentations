### Introduction (0min)

Introduce the topic by showing magical example. It should take just a few minutes to stand up a database server. Locally
create a rails project that talks to this database.

Pass around USB sticks so that everyone has VirtualBox and Vagrant installed. Want to reach a point where everyone is
ready to run `script/database up`. While everyone is running that go into the mechanics of Vagrant.

### What is Vagrant (10min)

Draw how AWS webservices are IAAS.
