# Git Workshop

## Abstract

Git Ready - Starting Your Git Journey

When I first started using git, it was for my own personal projects on GitHub. There weren't any collaborators and I
thought git was pretty easy. Then... I started working on a team. Git is a very simple tool, working in a complex space
(distributed version control). This workshop starts with version control basics and the underlying graph data structure
used in git, then moves towards complexities due to the distributed nature of git.

Prerequisites
* [Install Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

Presentations:
* [Intro to Version Control](https://github.com/scottmuc/presentations/tree/master/intro-to-version-control)
* [The Human Git Graph](https://github.com/scottmuc/presentations/tree/master/git)

Workshop / Hands On:
* Human Git Graph Explained: Go through the Human Graph exercise step by step. This will be hands on with everyone's
  computer. They need to have git working, and some git configuration lessons will be introduced  
* Mining the Code Base: Go over source code history via log, and running scripts per commit to have time series data
* Managing Remotes: Understanding remotes requires understanding of distributed version control. This is where git
  usage breaks down the most.
* Git Puzzles: A set of problems that people can try out.
