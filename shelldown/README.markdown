## Introduction (5 minutes)

A shelldown is an event where you can show off your shell customisations. The shell is the most powerful tool that a
developer has. I like how Gary Bernhardt describes the unix command line as an IDE. Being able to customize your shell
exercises your understanding of it.

### Begin with a short presentation (5 minutes)

There's always something interesting to learn about the shell. Here are some sample topics:

* .bashrc vs .bash_profile
* termcaps
* streams
* exit codes
* shell programming
* runtime aliasing vs static aliases

### The Shelldown (10 minutes each)

Invite 2 people to show off their shells.
